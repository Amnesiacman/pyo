Events framework
============================

.. module:: pyo
   :noindex:

Tools to generate sequence of events.

The purpose of the Event framework is to allow the user to generate a
sequence of events with as few as possible parameters to specify.

Events is the heart of the framework. An Events object computes parameters,
generally designed with event generator objects, builds the events and plays
the sequence.
